# Happy Number


**In this python project, you'll be diving into the world of "happy" numbers.
A number is considered "happy" if by following a specific sequence,
it results in 1. The sequence is as follows: Starting with any positive integer,
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
These numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.**

## For Example: 19
- 1² + 9² = 82
- 8² + 2² = 68
- 6² + 8² = 100
- 1² + 0² + 0² = 1

**As you can see, we eventually reached 1, which makes 19 a "happy" number.
This project tasks you with creating a program that can accurately determine
whether any given positive integer is a happy number or not.**
